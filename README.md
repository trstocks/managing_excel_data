# Setup Instructions
## From Command Prompt / Terminal
1. Install Python3
2. Create a Virtual Environment
3. Install needed packages
## Alternative to running files in command prompt
Many users who work with large data will often use
a program called miniconda(lightweight version of anaconda) 
to perform the commands in a nicer web browser interface. The web interface,
called Jupyter Notebook, comes with the miniconda package. 
1. Once python 3 is installed, perform `pip install miniconda`
2. from the command line, create or change to the work environment you want to use.
3. )pen Jupyter Notebook
# Getting Started
- Use the Example data file for practice. 
- The program will read the file information and print certain areas out to the screen.
- The example data is an excel spreadsheet with 500 records in it. The data is fake.

## Python
- functions look like this:
```python
def func_name():
    # Code goes here.
```
- spaces/tabs matter. If there's something wrong, 
  you'll likely see an error like `IndentationError: unexpected indent`
  when something isn't aligned properly.


# Pandas
- Pandas Column = Excel Column
- Pandas Index = Excel Row Number
- Pandas Series can either refer to a row or a column 
  of data in Excel. Think of it like you're taking 
  a slice of information and pandas helps you control 
  what you want to take from the data for your needs. 

# Examples
1. Understanding Data Frames
1. Read data
2. Write data
3. dataframes   
4. find the data you're looking for
5. working with multiple sheets
6.
